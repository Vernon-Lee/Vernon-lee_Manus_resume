            <div class="bio">
                <p>I am Vernon-Lee Ryan Manus, born on 22 June 2002. I am striving to become a
                    Software Engineer. I work hard and spend a lot of time learning about programming,
                    doing research about programming and practice programming.</p>
                
                    <p>I am a second year student, and I am currently studying at HyperionDev. My first
                    year of programming I studied at CTU. I did a Software Development course in 2021.
                    I don't have work experience when it comes to programming, but I am eager to learn
                    and grow as a programmer. I am passionate about programming. I see programming as a
                    hobby and not just as work. I enjoy learning technology and because coding is not always
                    easy I find it exciting. </p>
                
                    <p>My motivation is that I want to be able to be a flawless programmer. I want to be able
                    to understand and use any programming language I encounter. I also want to learn other young
                    people to code so that they can see a future as a programmer. I want to start my own company
                    when I have a decent amount of real-world experience, and I want to help my community grow.</p>
